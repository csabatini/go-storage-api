description: Display system architecture and data flow

# System Architecture

Display the current system architecture.

## Instructions

1. Read `project-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Read `project-docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` (if exists)
3. Display the architecture overview, data flow, and service map

If these documents don't exist yet, suggest creating them with:
- ASCII architecture diagram showing data flow
- Service responsibility table (Does / Does NOT)
- Port assignments
- Technology choices and WHY they were chosen

## Reminder

Architecture docs should be AUTHORITATIVE:
- "This document is AUTHORITATIVE. No exceptions."
- Use "If you are about to... STOP" pattern for boundaries
- Include "Does / Does NOT" tables to prevent scope creep
